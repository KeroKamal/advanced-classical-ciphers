Below is an advanced, in‐depth README (with plenty of emojis!) along with a sample `requirements.txt` file. This README explains the four classical cipher implementations—Caesar, Affine, Rail Fence, and Hill—in detail, describes how to run each one interactively, and highlights design and security considerations. You can copy these files into your GitHub repository.

# 🔏 Advanced Classical Ciphers Toolkit

Welcome to the **Advanced Classical Ciphers Toolkit**! This repository contains educational implementations of several classical encryption algorithms, complete with step-by-step breakdowns and interactive prompts. Whether you’re learning about cryptography for the first time or looking to review classical techniques, this project is designed to both inform and inspire. 🚀

## 📚 Overview

This toolkit contains the following ciphers:

- **Caesar Cipher**  
  A basic substitution cipher that shifts letters by a fixed amount.  
  - **Modes:**  
    - **Alphabetical:** Only shifts letters (maintaining case)  
    - **ASCII:** Shifts any printable ASCII character  
  - **Usage:** Encryption and decryption of messages using a constant shift value  
  - 🍏🔠 *Example: "mario" with a shift of 3 becomes "pdurl" (alphabetical mode).*

- **Affine Cipher**  
  A generalized version of the Caesar cipher that uses both multiplication and addition.  
  - **Parameters:**  
    - `key_a` (multiplier) must be chosen such that it is invertible mod 26 (or mod 128 for ASCII mode)  
    - `key_b` (shift) is added after multiplication  
  - **Modes:**  
    - **Alphabetical Mode (mod 26)**  
    - **ASCII Mode (mod 128)**  
  - 🔢🔐 *Interactive prompts guide you through providing keys and modes.*

- **Rail Fence Cipher**  
  A transposition cipher that writes the message in a zigzag (rail) fashion and then reads it off row-by-row.  
  - **Key:** `depth` (number of rails)  
  - **Special Handling:**  
    - Spaces are recorded and reinserted into their original positions after encryption  
  - ⛓️✂️ *A fun method that scrambles the order of letters while preserving word spacing.*

- **Hill Cipher**  
  A polygraphic cipher based on linear algebra over a finite set of numbers.  
  - **Key:** A square matrix (2x2 or 3x3) formed from the key text  
  - **Requirements:**  
    - The key length must be a perfect square (e.g., 4 for 2×2, 9 for 3×3)  
    - The key matrix must be invertible modulo the selected modulus (26 for alphabetical, 128 for ASCII)  
  - **Process:**  
    - Converts plaintext to numbers  
    - Encrypts using matrix multiplication and modulo arithmetic  
    - Displays intermediate calculations such as determinants, adjugate matrices, and modular inverses  
  - 💠📐 *A great example for those who love the mix of algebra and cryptography.*

## 🚀 How to Run

Each cipher is implemented with interactive prompts so you can see the full encryption/decryption process alongside intermediate calculations. **Note:** Since multiple ciphers are defined in one file with their own `if __name__ == "__main__":` sections, you might want to run or test them separately by commenting out the sections you are not using or by splitting them into separate modules.

### Caesar Cipher
- **Description:** Shifts each character by a given amount.
- **Run Command:**

  ```bash
  python caesarcipher.py
  ```

- **Expected Interaction:**
  - It will encrypt and print the message using an alphabetical mode and ASCII mode.
  - Sample output:
    ```
    Encrypted (Alphabetical): pdurl
    Decrypted (Alphabetical): mario
    Encrypted (ASCII): [some shifted version]
    Decrypted (ASCII): mario
    ```
- 🍏🔠

### Affine Cipher
- **Description:** Applies a mathematical transformation using keys `a` and `b`.
- **Run Command:**

  ```bash
  python affinecipher.py
  ```

- **Expected Interaction:**
  - Enter the plain text  
  - Provide valid integer keys (`key_a` and `key_b`)  
  - Choose mode: 'alphabet' (mod 26) or 'ascii' (mod 128)  
  - Outputs both encrypted and decrypted text.
- 🔢🔐

### Rail Fence Cipher
- **Description:** Rearranges the characters to encrypt by writing them in a zigzag pattern.
- **Run Command:**

  ```bash
  python railfencecipher.py
  ```

- **Expected Interaction:**
  - Enter the message and rail depth (key).  
  - The program displays the encrypted version with spaces reinserted in their original positions and then decrypts it to show the original message.
- ⛓️✂️

### Hill Cipher
- **Description:** Uses matrix operations to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- **Run Command:**

  ```bash
  python hillcipher.py
  ```

- **Expected Interaction:**
  - Enter plain text and key text (which should form a perfect-square length).  
  - Choose the mode: 'a' for alphabetical (mod 26) or 'ascii' (mod 128).  
  - Follow each step as the program prints detailed calculations (e.g., determinant, adjugate, modular inverses, encrypted vectors).

## 🔗 API & Interactive Usage

While these implementations are currently command-line apps (with interactive input/output), you could later adapt them into web APIs or graphical interfaces. For example:

- **API Endpoint Example (Conceptual for Caesar Cipher):**

  - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/caesar`
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "text": "mario",
      "shift": 3,
      "mode": "alphabetical",
      "encrypt": true
    }
    ```
  - **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "result": "pdurl"
    }
    ```

This project is designed so that you easily extend it with new features or integration into larger systems. 🚀

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Educational Purpose:** All these ciphers are classical and should **not** be used for securing sensitive data.
- **DES & Caesar/affine/rail fence/hill:** Modern cryptography is far more complex. These implementations serve to help understand basic techniques and the pitfalls of simple encryption.
- **Key Management:** Be sure to use strong (and if applicable, randomized) keys when experimenting, even in an educational context.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- **Modularization:** Split the ciphers into individual modules or packages.
- **Web API:** Develop RESTful endpoints for online encryption/decryption.
- **GUI:** Create a user-friendly graphical interface (e.g., using Tkinter or a web framework) to experiment with these ciphers.
- **Additional Ciphers:** Consider adding more classical methods (e.g., Vigenère, Playfair) and modern algorithms for comparison.
